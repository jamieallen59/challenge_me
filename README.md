**The Problem**

At the moment, raising money for charity can be quite boring. It boils down to a combination of issues faced by both the participant and sponsor.

1. Problems:
  + People do not want to get spammed all the time.
  + It is quite difficult to remain motivated to carry out your charity event.
  + Asking for sponsorship money can be quite difficult for all parties involved.
  + It's hard for the trainee to get people interested in what they are doing.
  + It's hard to ask for money for something that could be happening at a much later date. 

2. Our Aims:
  + To help motivate the person training for their event and holding them accountable publicly for it.
  + To make sponsors feel less resentful if there is a concept of achievements or challenges involved.
